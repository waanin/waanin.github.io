	Remember the DeadBeef problem?  Of course you do!

	Arbor remembers it too. Here is a picture of one of the Arbor engineers wearing his "Deadbeef" T-shirt that they had made.
	Not exactly something we want to be famous for ... but it is a funny name for a defect.

	Thanks for your help getting this resolved!

	Brian
